# Scripts for Interpretable Machine Learning to Understand Wildfire Toxicity: Bridging Chemicals and Multi-Omics

The aim of this project was to develop and apply code for symbolic regression (SR)-based analyses to bridge chemical exposure data and transcriptomic responses to wildfire smoke. This repository contains all the code, data inputs, intermediate files, model outputs, and figures used to support the analyses described in the project.

## Repository Structure

### 1_Data_inputs  
Includes raw input data used for model training and evaluation. These datasets include chemical exposure and transcriptomic response profiles.

### 2_Code  
Contains all scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and figure generation.

### 3_Data_intermediates  
Stores processed datasets and intermediate files generated during the data cleaning, transformation, and analysis pipeline.

### 4_Model_results  
Contains output files from trained SR models, including models selected for interpretation.

### 5_Plots  
Includes all generated figure images as well as supporting plots used for interpretation.
